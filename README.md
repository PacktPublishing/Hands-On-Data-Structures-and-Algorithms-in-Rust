 Hands-On Data Structures and Algorithms in Rust [Video], published by Packt

This is the code repository for [Hands-On Data Structures and Algorithms in Rust [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/in/programming/hands-on-data-structures-and-algorithms-in-rust-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## About the Video Course
Rust is a modern systems programming language designed with safety to simplify the development of large, complex software projects. Data structure and Algorithms are key to help in the collection and organization of the data for performing operations on the data and set instructions/logic to accomplish tasks in these projects. This course will be your guide for implementing classic data structures and algorithms in Rust, helping you to get up and running as a confident Rust programmer.

You will begin with a primer to Rust and its syntax. You will then explore the language of Time and Memory complexity by comparing different sorting methods. You’ll then learn about Lists and Binary Trees, implement them, and compare them, to show the advantages and use cases of each. Next, you will cover different algorithms in-depth such as sorting, graph, dynamic programming, greedy, divide and conquer, and more. You will learn how counterintuitive techniques can actually make it easier to build scalable projects!

By the end of the course, you will have a sound knowledge of the key data structures and algorithms in Rust to confidently implement them in your applications.
